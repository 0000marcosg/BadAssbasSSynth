# BadAssbasSSynth
Arduino based hardware synth project

This is my Arduino based hardware synth, originally intended as a bass synth. Turned out to be much more than that :-)
Produces gritty sounds of all kinds
Includes a rather powerful step sequencer
Features a funky waveform display
and much more

See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvDILHYImc4 for a short introduction.

Schematics, cheat sheet and all source files are included.
The main source file also contains a brief overview of the functions.
